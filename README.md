# TinCanRust (WIP)

This repository is a Rust portation of [TinCan.NET](https://github.com/RusticiSoftware/TinCan.NET). The aim is to implement it one by one like the TinCan.NET library.
Thus, I will place the same license here.

This library is not completed and is published for public contribution. You are welcome to clone this repository and complete implementing structs.

I will list the progress here soon.
